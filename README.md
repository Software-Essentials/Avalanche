## Troubleshooting

### Port in use

The default port is 80. Often times that port is in use and that causes problems.
To resolve this issue you can do two things; you can shutdown the application that is currently using that port on your machines and then retry. Alternatively, you can change the port in the environment file. This file can be found in "*app/environments/*". By default this file is called "*development.environment.json*".
